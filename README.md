# DBMS-Project
**Lab Project for CSE-2241 Database Systems Lab.**

## SYNOPSIS
This project involves the development of a **hostel room allocation** system designed to automate and streamline the process of assigning dormitory rooms to students in educational institutions. The system implements a preference-based allocation mechanism where students input their personal information, academic performance GPA, and preferences including dietary requirements and desired block/floor locations.
The system employs a scoring algorithm that weighs multiple factors including academic performance, student preferences, and special requirements to determine room assignments. Students can track their application status through the platform, while administrators can manage room inventory and execute allocation rounds based on the predefined criteria. By automating what is traditionally a manual and time-consuming process, this system aims to create a fair and efficient room allocation experience while reducing administrative overhead. The platform emphasizes ease of use and transparency in the allocation process, ensuring a straightforward experience for both students and administrators
